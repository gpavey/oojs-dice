**Model View Controller - Oject Oriented JavaScript**

A simple JavaScript / JQuery program that adds dice with the click of a button and randomly rolls the dice with the click of another.

The JavaScript is an example to show how js can be written in an object oriented way.  

All functions are named.

The code is also broken down into an MVC pattern and could easily be split into 3 separate files.
